# Bridge Command â›µ

This is the source code for Bridge Command, developed in C++ using the Irrlicht 3d library.
For more information, see https://www.bridgecommand.co.uk

Fork to SOMOS-Project (ENSM-Nantes), for more information see : https://somos-project.fr/

## To rebuild Irrlicht on Windows (optionnal to build BC)
1) (optionnal) Get Irrlicht from SVN repo here : svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/irrlicht/code/trunk
2) (optionnal) Replace in lib/irrlicht

## To rebuild Irrlicht on Linuxs (mandatory to build BC)
1) (optionnal) Get Irrlicht from SVN repo here : svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/irrlicht/code/trunk
2) (optionnal) Replace in lib/irrlicht
3) Go to lib/irrlicht/source/Irrlicht/ 
4) Run "make sharedlib; make install"
5) Duplicate generated so files : cp /usr/local/lib64/libIrrlicht.so* /usr/local/lib/; cp /usr/local/lib64/libIrrlicht.so* /usr/lib/

## Add last version of Enet library (not mandatory to run BC)
1) Download tarball here : http://enet.bespin.org/Downloads.html
2) Untar into :  lib/enet

## To compile BC on Windows
1) Visual Studio 2022 (or greater) are used
2) Download NetCdf-4 library here : https://downloads.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf/
3) Install by default
4) Add BC project -> Generate

## To compile BC on Linux
1) Run "sudo apt-get install cmake mesa-common-dev libxxf86vm-dev freeglut3-dev libxext-dev libxcursor-dev portaudio19-dev libsndfile1-dev libopenxr-dev libenet-dev libnetcdf-dev"
2) Go to bin/linux 
3) Run "cmake ../../src; make" 

## Libsndfile (not mandatory to run BC):
Download and uncompress libsndfile-1.0.28.tar.gz from http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/files/libsndfile-1.0.28.tar.gz
Create a folder for the output, referred to as <Somewhere> (Absolute path)
Change directory to where you've uncompressed libsndfile, then run the following in the terminal window:

(If building to be compatible with older macOS versions, run export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.7 before building libsndfile and portaudio, and then open a new terminal before running the main Bridge Command build)

./configure --disable-shared --prefix=<Somewhere>
make
make install
cd <Somewhere>
cp -a lib <BridgeCommandSourceLocation>/libs/libsndfile/

## Portaudio (not mandatory to run BC):
Download and uncompress pa_stable_v190600_20161030.tgz from http://www.portaudio.com/archives/pa_stable_v190600_20161030.tgz
(For macOS Big Sur (11.0) and onwards, a more recent version is needed. 
I have successfully compiled with http://files.portaudio.com/archives/pa_snapshot.tgz created Sunday, 07-Mar-2021 01:23:04 UTC)
Change directory to where you've uncompressed Portaudio, then run the following in the terminal window:

./configure --disable-mac-universal --disable-shared --enable-static
make
cd lib/.libs/
cp * <BridgeCommandSourceLocation>/libs/portaudio/lib/

3) Download and install CMake using the OSX package from https://cmake.org/download/
4) Open a terminal, and change directory to the 'bc/bin' directory, and run './makeAndBuildApp'
If successful, this will build into the BridgeCommand.app, then run it
This assumes that the CMake binary exists at /Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake
