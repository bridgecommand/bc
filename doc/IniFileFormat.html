<h2>Initialisation
file format (.ini)</h2>

<h3>Introduction:</h3>

<p>
This document sets out the common file format
used by Bridge Command for its initialisation files (with the
extension '.ini').
</p>

<h3>Assignment
format:</h3>

<p>The files use a NumericalVariableName=value
format for numerical values (eg. StartTime=21.25), and
TextVariable="contents" for textual values (eg. RadarImage="radar.jpg")</p>

<h3>Individual
and repeated variables:</h3>

<p>While some settings are unique, and only one
such value exists (eg. the start time of a scenario), others may need
to be defined many times (eg. each buoy has a type, a latitude and a
longitude value defined.) In this case, each object (in this case the
buoy) is numbered, and the object the variable refers to is placed in
brackets immediately after the variable name:</p>

<h4>Example (from Buoy.ini, see <a href="WorldFileSpec.html">World
file specification</a>):</h4>

<pre>
Number=3

Type(1)="Port"
Long(1)=-4.135
Lat(1)=52.407
Type(2)="RY"
Long(2)=-4.299
Lat(2)=55.004
Type(3)="Mooring"
Long(3)=-4.505
Lat(3)=52.702
</pre>

<p>This can be extended one step further, to two variable numbers. This is needed where there are a number of equivalent
objects (eg. other ships in the simulation), each of which has a number
similar definitions (track legs for other ships all have a bearing,
speed and distance defined. In this case, the object number comes
first, followed by the setting number (eg. '(ShipNo,LegNo)'). Note that
no white spaces are permitted in the entire variable name, so
'Distance(1,1)' is acceptable, but 'Distance (1,1)', 'Distance(1, 1)'
and 'Distance to run(1,1)' are all unacceptable. To clarify, an example
is included below, with simple, singly enumerated and doubly enumerated
variables, defining one ship with two course legs:</p>

<h4>Example (from Othership.ini, see <a href="Scenario.html">Scenario
specification</a>):</h4>

<pre>
Number=1

Type(1)="Timbercarrier"
InitialLong(1)=-5.0500
InitialLat(1)=50.1000
Legs(1)=2
Bearing(1,1)=060
Speed(1,1)=6
Distance(1,1)=8
Bearing(1,2)=135
Speed(1,2)=6
Distance(1,2)=100
</pre>

<h3>File
formatting</h3>

<p>The file can be laid out with blank lines as required, and the order of settings is not significant.</p>

<h3>Numerical
conventions:</h3>

<p>Latitude and longitude are defined in decimal
degrees, with North and East being positive. Times are defined in 24
hour decimal hours (so 16.25 means 4:15 PM). Nautical miles and metres
are both used as units of distance, as is appropriate. In general,
heights and short distances are in metres, while long distances are in
nautical miles. The unit of distance for variables will be given in the
file specification.</p>
