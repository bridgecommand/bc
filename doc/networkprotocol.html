<h1>Bridge Command Network Documentation</h1>
</div>

<p>
The networking protocol used in Bridge Command 5 has not yet been documented in detail. Bridge Command uses UDP port 18304 by default, and uses the
<a href="http://enet.bespin.org/">enet networking library</a>. 
</p>
<p>
If you want to write a program to interface with Bridge Command via its networking protocol, please see the source code of 
networkPrimary.cpp (used when Bridge Command is the master sending scenario information) and networkSecondary.cpp (used when Bridge Command 
is receiving scenario information, as a secondary display), or contact james@bridgecommand.co.uk.
