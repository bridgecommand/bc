<h1>Ship Models</h1>
</div>

<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p>Return to <a href="index.html">Documentation Home</a> or <a href="https://www.bridgecommand.co.uk">Bridge Command</a> homepage.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
There are two classes of other ship models that can be defined in Bridge Command. These are 'own ships' and 'other ships.' Ownships are models 
that have their full dynamics modelled, and are for use as the user's own ship. 'Other ships' are used to model all other ships in the 
environment. For details of what you can do with these, and how to load them in scenarios, please see the <a href="Scenario.html">Scenario 
specification</a> and the <a href="writer.html">Scenario writer</a>.
</p>

<p>
The most fundamental part of any ship model to load in Bridge Command is the 3D model itself. This can be in DirectX (.x) or 3DS Max format 
(.3ds). Additionally, for own ship models, equirectangular panoramic photos can be used. For more details on this, please see below.
Alongside the model, the text file boat.ini is used to define the other characteristics. The specification of this file is detailed 
below, but for a general introduction to the .ini file format used by Bridge Command, please read <a href="IniFileFormat.html">the .ini file 
format</a>. 
</p> 

<p>
Each vessel is contained in a folder, with the vessel's name, under Models\Othership  or Models\Ownship as appropriate. So if Bridge Command 
is installed in its default location, an own ship model called 'Protis' would be at 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Bridge Command X.X\models\Ownship\Protis'.
Bridge Command also looks in the user directory, which can be found using the button on the Bridge Command launcher, so users can add new ship models 
without needing to be able to make changes in the installation directory.
</p>

<h2><a name="own" /a>Own ships</h2>

<p>
The 3D model to load, and all of the characteristics of the own ship model are defined in the file Boat.ini in the model's folder. In addition,
 a file Radar.ini sets up the parameters for the radar. A complete example of both files is given below, and the effect of each line is 
explained below this: 
</p>

<p>
If you are using panoramic photos for the own ship, each photo must be an equirectangular panorama, with transparency set for all areas of the photo 
that are not part of the ship. So for example, all bridge windows must be transparent, so Bridge Command can render the surrounding scene. To use this 
mode, instead of specifying a model file with the FileName parameter, FileName="360" should be used. The view positions are defined as for a normal ship 
model, and are set as follows:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Views: The number of viewpoints on board the vessel (Minimum 1)</li>
    <li>For each viewpoint, where # is the viewpoint number:
    <ul>
      <li>ViewX(#): The viewpoint's X coordinate (in the model's unit system)</li>
      <li>ViewY(#): The viewpoint's Y coordinate (in the model's unit system)</li>
      <li>ViewZ(#): The viewpoint's Z coordinate (in the model's unit system)</li>
      <li>Pano(#): The filename of the equirectangular panorama image (must support transparency)</li>
      <li>PanoRotationYaw(#): Optional: The angle correction in the yaw direction (around vertical), in degrees</li>
      <li>PanoRotationPitch(#): Optional: The angle correction in the pitch direction, in degrees</li>

<ul>
<li>FileName: Sets the name of the 3D model file to load</li>
<li>ScaleFactor: The amount to scale the 3D model by. Bridge Command uses metres as it's units, so if the model is in feet, then this should be around 0.3</li>
<li><b>Note that all subsequent positions/distances are in the units/coordinate system of the 3D model file, except for the propulsion system.</b></li>
<li>YCorrection: The amount to move the model UP. Therefore, if the model's origin is at its keel, this should be a negative value</li>
<li>AngleCorrection: The number of degrees the model should be rotated about its vertical axis to correctly align it: The Bridge Command axis system is Y up and Z towards the model's stern (when viewed in a 3d model editor with a right handed coordinate system. Bridge Command uses a left handed coordinate system internally, so the Z axis is towards the ship's bow)</li>
<li>Depth: The vessel's depth under the water line (in the 3D model's units)</li>
<li>Views: The number of viewpoints on board the vessel (Minimum 1)</li>
<li>For each viewpoint, where # is the viewpoint number:
<ul>
<li>ViewX(#): The viewpoint's X coordinate (in the model's unit system - as long as AngleCorrection is zero)</li>
<li>ViewY(#): The viewpoint's Y coordinate (in the model's unit system - as long as AngleCorrection is zero)</li>
<li>ViewZ(#): The viewpoint's Z coordinate (in the model's unit system - as long as AngleCorrection is zero)</li>
<li>ViewHigh(#): (Optional) Set this to 1 if this is an elevated view, where the camera should automatically look straight down when switching to this view</li>
</ul></li>
<li>MakeTransparent (Optional): If this is set to 1, any part of the model that is partially transparent will be made fully transparent. This is useful where models have bridge windows where the material used partially obscures the view.</li>
<li>HasDepthSounder: If this is set to 1, a depth sounder reading is displayed</li>
<li>MaxDepth: If there is a depth sounder, the maximum depth that can be measured (m)</li>
<li>HasGPS: If this is set to 1, the GPS position will be displayed</li>
<li>HasRateOfTurnIndicator: If this is set to 1, a rate of turn indicator will be displayed</li>

<!-- DEE_DEC22 vvvv -->
<li>BlockCoefficient (Optional): The ratio of the volume a ships hull displaces of water and the volume of a cuboid of the same length, breadth and draught as the ship.  It is used to calculate the ships mass.  A typical values are 0.68 for a high speed container ship, 0.75 for an LNG tanker, 0.87 for a bulk carrier.  If BlockCoefficient is defined then it overrides Mass and Inertia parameters as the ships mass and inertias are calculated from the dimensions of the ship model and draught.  So if Block Coefficient is defined then there is no need to define Mass , Inertia.  If however a non displacement craft such as a  hovercraft is being modelled then the mass would need to be explicitly declared.</li>

<li>MaxSpeedAhead (Optional): The speed ahead of the vessel at maximum power ahead in knots.  If this is defined then it is not necessary to define maxForce, DynamicsSpeedA, DynamicsSpeedB, </li>

<li>AzimuthDrive (Optional): Set to 1 if the ship has azimuth drives, or 0 for conventional engine and rudder</li>

<li>aziToLengthRatio (needed for Azimuth Drive models):  the distance along the axis of the vessel of the azimuth drives expressed as a proportion of the vessels length.  Valid values lie between (0 and 1).  Typical values 0.2 for an azimuth stern drive tug, 0.1 for an azimuth driven coaster, 0.75 for a tractor tug</li>

<li>AzimuthDriveAstern (optional): Set to 1 if the azimuth drives can be engaged astern (for example for an outboard motor)</li>

<li>azimuthDriveEngineIdleRPM (needed for Azimuth Drive models): The engine RPM at which an engine idles with the thrust lever all the way back , engine declutched. It must be less than the azimuthDriveClutchDisengageRPM (a typical value for azimuthDriveEngineIdleRPM is 700)</li>

<li>azimuthDriveClutchDisengageRPM (needed for Azimuth Drive models): The engine RPM below which the clutch automatically disengages. It must be less than the azimuthDriveClutchEngageRPM but greater than the azimuthDriveEngineIdleRPM. (A typical value for azimuthDriveClutchDisengageRPM is 950)</li>

<li>azimuthDriveClutchEngageRPM (needed for Azimuth Drive models): The engine RPM which, when exceeded the clutch automaticall engages. It must be greater than the azimuthDriveClutchDisengageRPM (a typical value for azimuthDriveClutchEngageRPM is 1000)</li>

<li>engineMaxChangePerSecond (needed for Azimuth Drive models): the proportion of the maximum engine rpm that the engine can change rpm in one second.  e.g. 0.25 would mean it takes 4 seconds for an engine to go from a standstill to full power (typical value for a coaster 0.25, for an outboard engine on a speedboat 1, for a large bulk carrier 0.05)</li>

<li>schottelMaxDegPerSec (needed for Azimuth Drive models): the maximum number of degrees that a schottel control can be rotated in within one second.  It only applies to keyboard control for playability.  In reality the schottel control can be turned as fast as your wrist can move it, however it will take time for the azimuth drive to follow it up.  This is ignored if you have physical controls (typical value 60)</li>

<li>thrustLeverMaxChangePerSecond (needed for Azimuth Drive models) : the maximum proportion of the full range that a thrust lever control can be changed in within one second, e.g 0.2 would mean it takes 5 seconds for the lever to go from full back to full forward.  It only applies to keyboard control for playability.  In reality the thrust lever can be moved as fast as your wrist can move it, however it will take time for the engine to respond to it.  This is ignored if you have physical controls (typical value 0.4)</li>

<li>azimuthDriveMaxDegPerSecond (needed for Azimuth Drive models) : the maximum number of degrees that the azipod drive can rotate in the lateral plane in one second. (typically 30)</li>

<li>azimuthDriveSameDirectionAsSchottel (needed for Azimuth Drive models) : On most vessels the azimuth drive turns in the same direction as the shcottel, so the thrust lever is in the same direction as the actual thrust from the propellor.  So in the case of an azimuth stern drive configuration, the turning behaviour is similar to a tiller.  Turn the schottel clockwise and the ship will turn to port.  The opposite is true in a tractor configuration where the azimuth drives are ahead of amidships.  However, some vessels equipped with aft mounted azimuth drives (e.g. Lass class ships, Shetland Trader , Neptune) have a different control response, which is when the schottel is turned clockwise then the azimuth drive turns anticlockwise.  So when the schottel is turned clockwise the ship steers to starboard. So the thrust lever only points in the direction of the thrust when it is in the dead ahead or dead astern position.  The objective is to make it easier to steer.  Trust me it doesn't.  (value is typically and normally 1)</li>

<p>
<ul>
<li>FileName: Sets the name of the 3D model file to load</li>
<li>ScaleFactor: The amount to scale the 3D model by. Bridge Command uses metres as it's units, so if the model is in feet, then this should be around 0.3</li>
<li><b>Note that all subsequent positions/distances are in the units/coordinate system of the 3D model file</b></li>
<li>YCorrection: The amount to move the model UP. Therefore, if the model's origin is at its keel, this should be a negatve value</li>
<li>(Optional): SolidHeight: The maximum height at which the model should block radar targets behind it. If omitted, this defaults to about half of the height above the waterline. Note that this should be set in the model units and above the model's origin.</li>
<li>AngleCorrection: The number of degrees the model should be rotated about its vertical axis to correctly align it: The Bridge Command axis system is Y up and Z towards the model's stern (when viewed in a 3d model editor with a right handed coordinate system. Bridge Command uses a left handed coordinate system internally, so the Z axis is towards the ship's bow).</li>
<!--<li>OPTIONAL:
<ul>
<li>Filename2: If required, the filename of any secondary model file to be added to the ship model. This filename is relative to the ship's folder, so if one of the generic dayshapes is required, this can be set as "../Anchor.3ds" or similar.</li>
<li>x2: The location in the ship's coordinates that the second model should be loaded (x)</li>
<li>y2: The location in the ship's coordinates that the second model should be loaded (x)</li>
<li>z2: The location in the ship's coordinates that the second model should be loaded (x)</li>
<li>ScaleFactor2: The amount the additional model should be scaled by prior to adding it to the main model. The scaling applied to the whole ship is applied after this, so if the models are in the same units, this should be set as 1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OPTIONAL:
<ul>
<li>weapon_x: If the ship model's folder contains a subfolder called weapons, with base.x, turret.x and barrel.x models, if these are set, the weapon model will be added to the ship at the specified base position. This sets the x position</li>
<li>weapon_y: The weapon base y position.</li>
<li>weapon_z: The weapon base z position.</li>
</ul>
</li>-->
<li>NumberOfLights: The number of navigation lights</li>
<li>For each light, where # is the light number:
<ul>
<li>LightX(#): The light's X coordinate (in the model's unit system - as long as AngleCorrection is zero)</li>
<li>LightY(#): The light's y coordinate (in the model's unit system - as long as AngleCorrection is zero)</li>
<li>LightZ(#): The light's z coordinate (in the model's unit system - as long as AngleCorrection is zero)</li>
<li>LightRange(#): The maximum range of the light (in nautical miles)</li>
<li><b>The light's colour is defined in terms of it's red, green and blue values. Therefore a pure red light would have LightRed=255,LightGreen=0 and LightBlue=0:</b></li> 
<li>LightRed(#): The red colour component of the light (0-255).</li>
<li>LightGreen(#): The green colour component of the light (0-255).</li>
<li>LightBlue(#): The blue colour component of the light (0-255).</li>
<li>LightStartAngle(#): The bearing relative to the ship's head that a light is visible from. (0-360)</li>
<li>LightEndAngle(#): The bearing relative to the ship's head that a light stops being visible at. (0-720)</li>
<li><b>So for example, a port steaming light could have LightStartAngle(2)=247.5 and LightEndAngle(2)=361. Note that the LightEndAngle should be greater than the LightStartAngle, and can therefore be between 0 and 720 degrees</b></li>
<li>(Optional) Sequence(#): A text sequence of 'L' and 'D's. The case is not significant.
Each character represents a quater of a second of the sequence, and 'L'
represents the light being on, and 'D' is off. When the end of the
sequence is reached, the sequence restarts. So for example, <i>Sequence(#)="LLLDDDDDD"</i>
represents 0.75 seconds where the light is on, followed by 1.5 seconds
where it is off, then restarting with 0.75s of light and so on. If omitted, the light will be steady.</li>
<li>(Optional) PhaseStart(#): Which 'step' the light starts on, and should be given as an integer between 1 and the length of the sequence. For example, if you want two lights synchronised, you can give them the same sequence and set both to have a PhaseStart(#) of 1. If omitted or set to zero, the starting phase will be set randomly.</li>
