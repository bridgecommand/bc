Lantz FFT water implementation and the RealisticWaterSceneNode by elvman 
(https://github.com/elvman/RealisticWaterSceneNode), and the Serial library by 
William Woodall. Bridge Command depends on libsndfile, which is released under the

The Irrlicht Engine is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group, 
the zlib, and libpng.
