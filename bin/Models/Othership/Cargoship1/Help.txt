If you have slow frame rates with the Cargo Ship 

i suggest you to do the following things;

go to > options > game

Turn off underwater coastics (you don't need it isn't a submarine)
	 spray on waves       
	 stars at night (if you sail at day time)
	 moon at night (if you sail at day time)

set your water detail level to minimum 
decrease your water active area to 2 points from the left 

set the water transparency to zero same with wake transparency, you dont need them aswell cause youre not under water level

with all these settings off you should get an average frame rate of 25/30 frames/s 


----------------------------------------------------------

If you have problems during the startup (you got a message that was saying "boat cannot be loaded")


i suggest you to do the following things;

load a default scenery from thw options menu on startup, and change back your screen resolutions

now you can load the Cargo Ship again.
