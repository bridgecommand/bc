Detail around harbour

Overall is 513x513

Detail starting at lower left 79, 425 
to upper right  143, 361 
(64x64)

Primary terrain:

TerrainLong(1)=-10
TerrainLat(1)=50
TerrainLongExtent(1)=0.05010
TerrainLatExtent(1)=0.04008

So we have TerrainLong = -10 + 79/513 * 0.05010 = -9.992284795
TerrainLat = 50 + (513-425)/513 * 0.04008 = 50.006875322

LongExtent = 64/513*0.05010 = 0.006250292
LatExtent = 64/513*0.04008 = 0.005000234
