# Changelog for jnipp

## jnipp 1.0.0 (25-October-2023)

This release is somewhat of a formality, as jnipp has been used in production
environments for some time. It was prompted by the need for an API breaking
change to ensure continued compatibility with libc++ as they move to more
strictly follow the C++ standard.
