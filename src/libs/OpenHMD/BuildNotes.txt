Create a working folder called 'OpenHMD', in the same folder as the Bridge Command checkout 'bc'.
In this working folder, checkout OpenHMD (currently e64708b8213c52a6b0bbd7ad77e0ab910b5af6b8) from https://github.com/OpenHMD/OpenHMD.git

Download https://github.com/libusb/hidapi/releases/download/hidapi-0.13.1/hidapi-win.zip, and uncompress to create a folder 'hidapi-win' within the working folder. This should contain 'include', 'x86' and 'x64'.

So the overall hierachy should be

Parent folder
  -bc
  -OpenHMD
    -OpenHMD (the git checkout)
      -build (manually created within the checkout, see next step)
    -hidapi-win
      -include
      -x86
      -x64

Create a new folder 'build' within the OpenHMD checkout. In this folder, run:

cmake .. -DHIDAPI_LIBRARY="../../hidapi-win/x86/hidapi.lib" -DHIDAPI_INCLUDE_DIR="../../hidapi-win/include" -DOPENHMD_EXAMPLE_SIMPLE="OFF" -DBUILD_BOTH_STATIC_SHARED_LIBS="OFF" -G "MinGW Makefiles"
mingw32-make.exe

Will need dll from hidapi in bc/bin folder. There is no OpenHMD dll used, it is linked into Bridge Command.
