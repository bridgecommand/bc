To build on Linux:
==================

1) Ensure the required library packages are installed with the following command in the terminal window:
'sudo apt-get install cmake mesa-common-dev libxxf86vm-dev freeglut3-dev libxext-dev libxcursor-dev portaudio19-dev libsndfile1-dev'
2) Start a terminal session, and make sure you are in the 'bc/bin' directory
3) Run 'cmake ../src' to prepare the build files
4) Run 'make' to actually build the program 
5) Run './bridgecommand' to start the simulator.

To build on Mac OSX:
====================

1) Ensure you have XCode installed (required to compile programs on Mac). This can be obtained from the App Store
2) Build the required sound packages:

Libsndfile:
-----------
Download and uncompress libsndfile-1.0.28.tar.gz from http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/files/libsndfile-1.0.28.tar.gz
Create a folder for the output, referred to as <Somewhere> (Absolute path)
Change directory to where you've uncompressed libsndfile, then run the following in the terminal window:

(If building to be compatible with older macOS versions, run export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.7 before building libsndfile and portaudio, and then open a new terminal before running the main Bridge Command build)

./configure --disable-shared --prefix=<Somewhere>
make
make install
cd <Somewhere>
cp -a lib <BridgeCommandSourceLocation>/libs/libsndfile/

Portaudio:
----------
Download and uncompress pa_stable_v190600_20161030.tgz from http://www.portaudio.com/archives/pa_stable_v190600_20161030.tgz
(For macOS Big Sur (11.0) and onwards, a more recent version is needed. 
I have successfully compiled with http://files.portaudio.com/archives/pa_snapshot.tgz created Sunday, 07-Mar-2021 01:23:04 UTC)
Change directory to where you've uncompressed Portaudio, then run the following in the terminal window:

./configure --disable-mac-universal --disable-shared --enable-static
make
cd lib/.libs/
cp * <BridgeCommandSourceLocation>/libs/portaudio/lib/

3) Download and install CMake using the OSX package from https://cmake.org/download/
4) Open a terminal, and change directory to the 'bc/bin' directory, and run './makeAndBuildApp'
If successful, this will build into the BridgeCommand.app, then run it
This assumes that the CMake binary exists at /Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake
