# Bridge Command â›µ

This is the source code for Bridge Command, developed in C++ using the Irrlicht 3d library.
For more information, see https://www.bridgecommand.co.uk

Fork to SOMOS-Project (ENSM-Nantes), for more information see : https://somos-project.fr/

## To rebuild Irrlicht on Windows (not mandatory to build BC)
1) Get Irrlicht from SVN repo here : svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/irrlicht/code/trunk
2) Replace in lib/irrlicht
3) Download last DirectX SDK here : https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812
4) If needed, update Irrlicht properties to add include and libraries folder from DirectX SDK

## To rebuild Irrlicht on Linux/MacOs (not mandatory to build BC)
1) Get Irrlicht from SVN repo here : svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/irrlicht/code/trunk
2) Replace in lib/irrlicht
3) Go to lib/irrlicht/source/Irrlicht/ 
4) Run "make sharedlib; make install"
5) Duplicate generated so files : cp /usr/local/lib64/libIrrlicht.so* /usr/local/lib/

## Add last version of Enet library (not mandatory to run BC)
1) Download tarball here : http://enet.bespin.org/Downloads.html
2) Untar into :  bin/libs/enet/

## To compile BC on Windows
1) Visual Studio 2022 (or greater) are used
2) Add BC project -> Generate

## To compile BC on Linux
1) Run "sudo apt-get install cmake mesa-common-dev libxxf86vm-dev freeglut3-dev libxext-dev libxcursor-dev portaudio19-dev libsndfile1-dev libopenxr-dev"
2) Go to bc/bin directory, create a folder "linux" if not exist
3) Go to bc/bin/linux 
4) Run "cmake ../../src; make" 

## To compile BC on MacOs
1) Ensure you have XCode installed (required to compile programs on Mac). This can be obtained from the App Store. You will also need the Command line tools, which can be installed with 'sudo xcode-select --install'
2) Build the required sound packages:

## Libsndfile (not mandatory to run BC):
Download and uncompress libsndfile-1.0.28.tar.gz from http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/files/libsndfile-1.0.28.tar.gz
Create a folder for the output, referred to as <Somewhere> (Absolute path)
Change directory to where you've uncompressed libsndfile, then run the following in the terminal window:

(If building to be compatible with older macOS versions, run export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.7 before building libsndfile and portaudio, and then open a new terminal before running the main Bridge Command build)

./configure --disable-shared --prefix=<Somewhere>
make
make install
cd <Somewhere>
cp -a lib <BridgeCommandSourceLocation>/libs/libsndfile/

## Portaudio (not mandatory to run BC):
Download and uncompress pa_stable_v190600_20161030.tgz from http://www.portaudio.com/archives/pa_stable_v190600_20161030.tgz
(For macOS Big Sur (11.0) and onwards, a more recent version is needed. 
I have successfully compiled with http://files.portaudio.com/archives/pa_snapshot.tgz created Sunday, 07-Mar-2021 01:23:04 UTC)
Change directory to where you've uncompressed Portaudio, then run the following in the terminal window:

./configure --disable-mac-universal --disable-shared --enable-static
make
cd lib/.libs/
cp * <BridgeCommandSourceLocation>/libs/portaudio/lib/

3) Download and install CMake using the OSX package from https://cmake.org/download/
4) Open a terminal, and change directory to the 'bc/bin' directory, and run './makeAndBuildApp'
If successful, this will build into the BridgeCommand.app, then run it
This assumes that the CMake binary exists at /Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake

FFT water implementation and the RealisticWaterSceneNode by elvman

Brian C. Lane, and the Serial library by William Woodall. Bridge 
Command depends on libsndfile, which is released under the GNU Lesser
